AIM:Write a program to find the grace marks for a studentusing switch. The user
should enter the class obtained bythe student and the number of subjects he
has failed in.
Use the following rules:
i. If the student gets first class and the number of subjectsfailed is &gt;3, then
no grace marks are awarded. If thenumber of subjects failed is less than or
equal to &#39;3&#39; thenthe grace is 5 marks per subject.
ii. If the student gets second class and the number of subjectsfailed in is &gt;2,
then no grace marks are awarded. If thenumber of subjects failed in less
than or equal to &#39;3&#39; thenthe grace is 4 marks per subject.
iii. If the student gets third class and the number of subjectsfailed in is &gt;1,
then no grace marks are awarded. If thenumber of subjects failed in is equal
to &#39;1&#39; then the graceis 5 marks per subject

PROGRAM:

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int grade,failed;
	printf("enter the class obtained by the student");
	scanf("%d",&grade);
	printf("how many subjects has the student failed");
	scanf("%d",&failed);
	switch(grade)
	{
		case 1:
			if (failed>3)
				printf("no grace marks awarded");
			if (failed<=3)
				printf("your grace marks is 5");
			break;
		case 2:
			if (failed>2)
				printf("no grace marks awarded");
			if (failed<=3)
				printf("your grace marks is 4");
			break;
		case 3:
			if (failed>1)
				printf("no grace marks awarded");
			if (failed==1)
				printf("your grace marks is 5");
			break;
			default:("your entered wrong class for the student");
	}
	if(grade==1||grade==2||grade==3)
	{
		printf("the studet has obtained a grade marks of %d per subject",grade);
	}	
}
OUTPUT:
enter the class obtained by the student 6
